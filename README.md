# Causal Hidden Markov Model for Time Series Disease Forecasting
This repository is the python implementation of [Causal Hidden Markov Model for Time Series Disease Forecasting(CVPR2021)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Li_Causal_Hidden_Markov_Model_for_Time_Series_Disease_Forecasting_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf).

## The directed acylic graph (DAG) for our Causal-HMM.

### Re-implement the method on default setting by:
```
python main.py 
```
